# FastAPI

Fast API is going to bring new standards about what to expect from an API framework.
Fast API is a comparatively new framework but it is impressing me a lot. I found it so much simpler than the Django REST framework.

Here are the some basic pip file and the code file, in which i have done some CRUD operations and tried to use the FastAPI, u can have a look at the FastAPI documentation
   https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
Do give it a read and understand the FastAPI, it's much simpler and easy to understand and makes communication much friendly!
